the .zip contains 3 folders:
{build}  contains all files and executable of the program
{install} contains install compiler .iss works with inno setup compiler
{source} contains setup.py and arrange.py the source files of the program

You can download DC-setup alone to install the program or the whole build folder


the use of the program is free for all, u can edit it as you like, just give credits, it takes time and efforts to make things like this.
